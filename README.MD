### TCP echo server.

A TCP Echo Server is a simple echo server written in rust that works using the TCP protocol. 
The server listens to connection requests from a client and writes back the data on on the connection.

## How to use it.
Start the TCP server in a shell with:

```rust
rustc tcp-echo-server.rs && ./tcp-echo-server
```

start the client with in a new shell:
```rust
rustc tcp-client.rs && ./tcp-client
```

You can then enter text on the client and it will be echoed back...ðŸ™€
